Information for Grader:

All basic functions are implemented, plus an extra comment function. 

1, Website can handle multiple user situations. A user without login in can view posts and blogs, but when he wants to login in he has to user Google Account.

2, Bloglist page will just show all blogs, while single blog page will show at most 10 posts per page.

3, When user want to upload their own image, he must firstly post a new post, then click “Edit this post/Add images” to add image or change contents.

4, “RSS” word in Blogpage will supply rss feed of the current entire blog’s posts, one can be tested on online feed validation service: http://validator.w3.org/feed/

5, I already created a blog named ”Overall Test Blog” and post some test posts, wish it can help you.

Thank you!
